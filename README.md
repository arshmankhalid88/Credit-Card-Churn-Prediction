This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the Telco Customer Churn dataset, we aim to uncover insights that can help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## Project Goals
1. Analyze customer data to understand churn patterns.
2. Identify key features that influence customer churn.
3. Build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict churn.
4. Provide actionable insights for improving customer retention.

## Outline
1. **Materials and Methods**
2. **General Part**
   - i) Libraries Import
   - ii) Data Loading and Exploration
   - iii) Data Preprocessing
   - iv) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - v) Model Training and Evaluation
3. **Key Analysis Questions**

## Materials and Methods
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). This dataset contains information about customers, including demographic details, account information, and whether they have churned.

## Key Analysis Questions
- What percentage of customers have churned?
- Are there any patterns in customer churn based on demographic factors such as gender and age?
- Which services are most associated with customer churn?
- What features have the most significant impact on predicting customer churn?
- Which machine learning model performs best for predicting churn?

Additionally, we will conduct a visual analysis to enhance the understanding of customer behavior and churn patterns.

## Libraries Used
1. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
2. **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
3. **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
4. **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
5. **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
6. **XGBoost**: For advanced gradient boosting algorithms.
7. **Imbalanced-learn**: For handling imbalanced datasets.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the libraries individually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn
   ```

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and churn prediction, enabling businesses to implement effective strategies for customer retention and improve overall customer satisfaction.
